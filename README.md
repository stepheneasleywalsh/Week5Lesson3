# Error Codes
## You must write some Python code that contains a function for checking what a website error code means. You must use "match".
### Meaning of codes:
Error codes and what they mean
Error code: 400
A 400 error code relates to an issue with the browser. This occurs when the message is identified as corrupt and the request which the server receives cannot respond with the correct requested information. 

Error code: 401
This error code is related to authorisation credentials. It will usually appear when the user does not have authorisation to enter the page. Luckily, this is something that can be tackled by the user in a few easy steps – sometimes it’s just the cache that needs to be cleared from a browser, and then a trusty old refresh of the chosen page.

Error code: 403
A 403 error code is another code that relates to permission. This message will usually appear with the above error code when a user has signed in but does not have permission to access the requested page. 

Error code: 404
The most famous and well-known error code of them all – the 404. This is a response from the server informing the user that it cannot find the page they are looking for. It’s an indicator of the page not working properly and needs to be fixed. For a website owner, the silver lining to this page is that it’s a great opportunity to make the message into something fun and engaging that could potentially go viral!

Error code: 408
Unlike the other error codes, this is a time-out code that the user might have caused by stopping the request before the server has retrieved the information. It can also be an indicator of a slow-running server so it’s best to monitor the server if this message appears. 

Error code: 500
Like the 404 error code for customers, 500 is the most common error code internally for those monitoring server issues. It usually indicates an issue with the user request not being able to communicate with the server which results in an error 500 message appearing.  

Error code: 502
This error message indicates something more serious with the server connection. It’s a connectivity issue as the server the user is requesting the information from is not connected and indicates a Bad Gateway problem. A solution to this would be to use a server monitoring tool that can alert you when the server goes down.

Error code: 503
If your website is currently offline the users trying to access the server will get this error code. Usually, this occurs when there is planned maintenance work or unplanned downtime on the server. 

Error code: 504
The timeout error occurs when the server is taking longer than the required period for a response. This error message is generated in this case and it could be an indicator that there is an issue with the server or simply a one-off issue that caused the response time to take longer than usual.
